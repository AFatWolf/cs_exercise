        This book introduces students with <u>little or no prior programming experience</u> to the art of
        computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab.
        It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational
        techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of <i>data science</i> for using computation
        to model and interpret data. The book is based on an <strong>MIT course</strong> (which became the most popular
        course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a <i>conventional
            classroom but in in a massive open online course (MOOC)</i>

        <strong>Think Python</strong> is an introduction to Python programming for beginners. It starts with basic
        concepts of programming, and is carefully designed to define all terms when they are first
        used and to develop each new concept in a logical progression. Larger pieces, like recursion
        and object-oriented programming are divided into a sequence of smaller steps and introduced
        over the course of several chapters.
